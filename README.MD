The topic of the laboratory work is solving the task of search for the maximum flow in the network.

The network is represented as a graph. The graph is represented as a matrix. The matrix is filled in as follows: if there is a direct path between the nodes, then its weight is recorded, otherwise 0. The Ford Fulkerson algorithm is used to find the flow.

The input matrix can be read from the user's txt file or randomly generated by the program.

File **main.cpp** contains the entry point to the program.
